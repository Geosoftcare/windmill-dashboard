                              <h6 class="card-title">Geosoft’s Care Privacy Policy</h6>
                              At Geosoft Care, we are committed to protecting your privacy by ensuring the security of your data, especially as it applies to all organisations using our software. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your staff and client information when you use our app. By using the Geosoft Care App, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

                              <br><br>
                              <h6 class="card-title">The Geosoft Care App</h6>
                              The Geosoft Care App offers a web-based control tool and a mobile application for data exchange, reporting, and storage in a database. Our software operates within a closed environment, ensuring that any data entered by our clients are never shared with unauthorised third parties for marketing purposes. All data is strictly used for internal purposes within Geosoft Care and is accessible only to subscribed organisations and their relevant data control officers.
                              User organisations retain full control over their data, with the ability to add, edit, and amend information.


                              <br><br>
                              Certain data can be deleted by users, while other types require a written request submitted to us directly or through our complaint and ticketing system.
                              <br>
                              End users cannot contact us directly for data removal; such requests should be directed to the organisations utilising our system. We never delete data without written consent from our direct clients (organisations), as we do not act as data controllers.
                              In some instances, we may utilise third-party services to access information such as location data from employee or employer-owned mobile devices. However, we strictly adhere to minimal data-sharing practices, providing only the necessary information for the service to function. For example, when determining device locations, we only transmit latitude or longitude coordinates to the Google Services API, with the resulting address stored solely for the purpose of our services. No additional personal information is shared during this process.
                              Similarly, when utilising web-based systems to obtain address coordinates, any information received from Google remains confidential and is not shared with any other party.

                              <br><br>
                              When we provide services under contract with any organisation, that organisation assumes control as the data processor and controller within our system.
                              The above clarification indicates that the Geosoft Care App is designed for organisational use. When the services are provided for you through an organisation (such as your employer), that organisation serves as the administrator of the services and assumes responsibility for the end-users and/or service sites under its control. We do not assume responsibility for an administrator's organisational privacy or security practices, which may differ from ours as stated in this policy.
                              For further clarification, please get in touch with your organisation’s data controller or consult your administrator's organisational policies.

                              <br><br>
                              <h6 class="card-title">Payment Information:</h6>
                              Geosoft Care does not collect banking details, as our system does not accommodate such information. Any banking information provided by companies is for internal purposes only and not utilised directly by us.

                              <h6 class="card-title">Usage Information</h6>

                              <h6 class="card-title">Device Information, Cookies and Tracking Technologies:</h6>
                              We collect device-related data, such as connection settings and device identifiers, to optimise Service performance. Your IP address may be used to approximate your location for improved service delivery.
                              We employ cookies and tracking technologies to provide functionality and recognise users across devices. Opting out of these technologies may affect Service functionality.

                              <br><br>
                              <h6 class="card-title">Information Received from Other Sources:</h6>
                              Data is only entered into our system by our direct client base. We receive information solely from our clients or authorised third parties.

                              <br><br>
                              <h6 class="card-title">How We Use Collected Information:</h6>
                              We use collected information for research and development, customer support, safety and security, and protection of legal rights, and we use it with your consent for specific purposes.

                              <br><br>
                              <h6 class="card-title">Data Hosting and Security:</h6>
                              We utilise UK-based data hosting providers and implement robust security measures. While we strive to protect your data, no system is entirely immune to intrusion. Therefore, we will not be held liable for any data breach resulting from any organisational subscriber.

                              <br><br>
                              <h6 class="card-title">Data Retention:</h6>
                              Data entered by clients is archived over time and is only deleted if formally requested in writing. Marketing preferences are retained unless specifically requested for deletion. Information derived from cookies and tracking technologies is retained for a reasonable period.

                              <br><br>
                              <h6 class="card-title">Sharing Information:</h6>

                              <br><br>
